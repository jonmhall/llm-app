# LLM Apps Workshop

This repository provides the source code for Large Language Model (LLM) based applications that are used for blog posts, workshop and demos.

[Amazon Sagemaker Jumpstart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/studio-jumpstart.html) makes it simple to host LLMs as [Sagemaker Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/realtime-endpoints.html) enabling uses-cases for inference (text to text generation) and embeddings generation.

The LLM applications in this repo include inference, generating embeddings, question answer (zero-shot and few-shot learning, prompt engineering), retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and domain adapted fine-tuning (coming soon..).
